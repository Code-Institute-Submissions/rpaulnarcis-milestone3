#### Navigation on Tablet:
-  Navigation on tablet consisting of a hamburger droop down button with all the functionality Home, Login Register, Recipes, Add Recipes and Log Out.
#### Navigation on Desktop 
- Consist of A Navbar consisting of no hamburger droop down button with all functionality of Home, Login Register, Recipes, Add Recipes and Log Out.
#### Login, Logout and Register buttons
- all devices consist of these three buttons and they are all functional.
#### Known Bugs and fixes
-the base template slider was not present on all template pages so I created a second one called slider to facilitate these pages.
-I also got a lot of trouble in trying to achieve responsiveness on smaller devices using materializecss.
-Many errors came up when I checked my HTML was not quite sure if it was good or bad many of them seem to be from the python components I reached out to the tutors for advice but there was no response.
-I could latch on to the recipes for loop on the recipes page to apply propper CSS so as a result, my responsiveness on smaller devices suffered.
